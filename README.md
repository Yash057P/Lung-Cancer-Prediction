# Lung Cancer Prediction

üéØ Project Description:  

This repository contains a simple, interactive machine learning model built with Python and Scikit-learn to predict the likelihood of a patient having lung cancer. The model is trained on a synthetic survey dataset containing demographic information, lifestyle habits, and various symptoms.

The core of the project is a Random Forest Classifier, chosen for its robustness and performance in binary classification tasks. The script allows users to input new patient data interactively, providing not only a YES/NO prediction but also a Confidence Score, which serves as a measure of the model's certainty in its output.

üöÄ Getting Started

Prerequisites:  
To run this project, you need Python 3.x installed on your system.

Installation:  
Clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

    # Clone the repository (if hosted on GitHub)
    # git clone <your-repo-link>
    # cd lung-cancer-prediction-model 
    # Install dependencies
    pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy

Data Requirement:  
Ensure that the dataset file, survey lung cancer.csv, is placed in the same directory as the lung_cancer_predictor.py script.

üõ†Ô∏è How to Run the Model:  
The prediction script is designed to run directly from your terminal:

    python lung_cancer_predictor.py

Prediction Output:  
The output provides a clear result and an interpretation of the model's certainty:

    ==============================================
              ** PREDICTION RESULT **
    ==============================================
    Prediction: LUNG CANCER **YES**
    Confidence Score: 0.9450
    Confidentiality/Model Certainty: The model is **highly  certain** of this prediction.
    ==============================================

üí° Future Enhancements  
Implement feature importance analysis (e.g., using feature_importances_) to determine which symptoms contribute most to the prediction.

Containerize the application using Docker.

Wrap the model in a web service (e.g., Flask or Streamlit) for a user-friendly GUI.
